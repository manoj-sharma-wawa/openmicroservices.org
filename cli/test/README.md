# Test
## Exec
When ran in a directory of a microservice (a directory containing a `microservice.guide` and `Dockerfile`) this command will build
the microservice and execute a given command.
### Usage
```
exec [-e] [command] [args...]
```

#### command
Command is an optional argument. If supplied the microservice will be executed with the given command, else, the `entrypoint`
command will be executed. If no `entrypoint` is defined for the given command is not defined in the `microservice.yml` `exec`
will fail.

#### args...
If a command required arguments they can be passed as follows: `key:val`. If required arguments are not given `exec` will fail.

#### Environment variables
If the microservice has any required environment variables they must be passed in with the `exec` command. Much like Docker,
environment variables can be passed as follows: `-e FOO='bar'`. If a required environment variable is not supplied `exec` will fail.

### Example `exec` call
```sh
omg exec -e BOT_TOKEN='xoxb-****' send message:'Hello, World!' to:CAFAF9C
```
```sh
