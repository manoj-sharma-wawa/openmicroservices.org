# Overview

The Microservice Guide is an open standard for reusable microservices. 
The intent of this guide is to provide developers and operators with a framework to build, 
deploy, and operate microservices.

It's important to understand that this guide is to be used as a blueprint to build microservices. 
It can be applied to various technologies like Docker, Rocket, Spring Boot, Go kit, etc. 
It's on the developer to decide on the underlying infrastructure.
