# Overview

The Microservice Guide is an open standard for reusable microservices. The intent of this guide is to provide developers and operators with a framework to build, deploy, and operate microservices.

This guide is to be used as a blueprint to build services. It can be applied to various technologies like Docker, Rocket, Spring, etc. It's on the developer to decide on underlying infrastructure.
